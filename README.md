# **PartyPlanner**
## Mission statement
When we went on trips with friends, we had problems getting organized. We wanted an easy to use app that could help us stay on track with the items we need and the money we spend on vacation.

<br>
We didn't find anything useful that was free. All the apps that seemed good were paid, which we didn't like... So we set out to create our own solution that would fit our needs and maybe even your's.
